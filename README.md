# Mini Matlab Clone

## Features

* Array and matrix creation using variables:
```
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6]
c = [45, 67, 34; 32, 1, 6]
```

*Creating zero matrices using the 'zeros' method:
```
z = zeros(5,1)
```

*Matrix and array operations:
  *Addition of a matrix and a number:
  ```
  a + 10
  ```
  *Transposing a matrix using an apostrophe operator ('):
  ```
  a'
  ```
  *Inverse of a matrix:
  ```
  inv(a)
  ```

*Concatenation, i.e. joining two arrays to form a larger one:
  *Horizontal concatenation:
  ```
  A = [a,b]
  ```
  *Vertical concatenation:
  ```
  B = [a;b]
  ```
